            <strong>
                Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer Medal for
                Best New Simulation Board Game.
            </strong>
            Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient Greece and Rome
            in an attempt to manage the administration of a city. Each role
            provides a different ability and strategy. However, one role card
            belongs to a deadly assassin and players must be constantly aware of
            betrayal and double-cross. This card game provides a ton of
            enjoyment and can handle up to eight players and expansion packs
            available for larger parties. This is a nicely balanced game, where
            each player must carefully choose his or her roles and the
            strategies can quickly change with the turn of a card. However the
            level of randomness is just right and cunning and resourcefulness
            can overcome bad luck (if given time.)
            <em>
                I do not recommend this game unless there are at least 4
                players;
            </em>
            less than that reduces the intrigue and some of the game appeal.

        <h2>Highly Recommended</h2>

        <img src="../images/tower2.png" alt="tower 2" class="added-images">

        <blockquote>
            Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is just about
            perfect and each player must carefully choose roles each turn. Even
            though the strategic possibilities are nearly endless, the game is
            simple to learn. The replay value is high and gets even better when
            you replace some of the cards with new cards available in the
            expansion packs.

        <h2>Great Strategic Board Game</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 to 6 players
                and we can strongly recommend the game.
            </em>
            The different phases of the game are interesting and intriguing,
            from bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. With
            the variety of cards and scenarios, no two games are ever quite the
            same. It's a great introduction to the world of strategic board
            games and role playing.

        <h2>An Incredible Game</h2>

        <img src="../images/temple1.png" alt="template 1" class="added-images">

        <blockquote>
            <em>
                The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent and one of
                the best around.
            </em>
            As for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there are tough
            decisions to make every turn. It's not only important to select the
            character that increases your chances for scoring, but also to
            anticipate the characters the opponents are likely to select, and
            then hedge against their availability. This causes a lot of
            unpredictability and deep strategic thinking. However, it can still
            be played at a more basic level for younger users. We had a lot of
            fun with this game and rate it as Best in its Class. Highly
            recommended.
