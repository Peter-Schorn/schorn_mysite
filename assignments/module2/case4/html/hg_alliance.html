        <h2>Decide the Fate of the World</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide the outcome. As
            one of the world powers battling for supremacy you must lead your
            country's military drive; but you can't do it alone. You have to
            form alliances and then betray your allies before they betray you!
            Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity of the
            strike. Will it be a bombing raid, an offshore missile barrage, or
            an invasion with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, move into
            enemy territory with your forces and win the conflict. The economic
            destiny of your nation is also at stake. Buy armaments and develop
            secret weapons from your country's economic funds and natural
            reserves, but be sure to save something for the future.

        <h2>Tedious and Confusing</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The list of war simulation games is long. All of them share
                similar features including the formation of temporary Alliance
                and battles simulated through random draws of a deck or the roll
                of the die. Alliance offers very little that is new or
                innovative in that regard.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing.
                </em>
                In fact, I dare say we spent more time reading and rereading the
                rule book than actually playing the game. If you want to read a
                book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

        <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the game play
                to be robust and engaging. The rules are long and drawn out but,
                for anyone with experience in this class of board games, there
                is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We think the
                battle simulation cards are some of the best we have
                encountered.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of that being said, the competition for this type of game is
                fierce. There are a lot of established titles with loyal
                clients. We're not exactly sure where Alliance fits in with that
                group. It's a good game, but not good enough to draw our
                attention away from games like Battle Tested and Global
                Conflict.

        <h2>Fun and Challenging</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to war game
                enthusiasts. We think it offers several new ideas that we're
                surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The
                card system and the investment options give the game a "real
                world" feel.
